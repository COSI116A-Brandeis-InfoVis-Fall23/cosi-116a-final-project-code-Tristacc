      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>Our project is to provide basic guidance and assist recent graduates in making informed decisions about housing
        in the Boston area. The way we address the need is to present the comparison of the average minimum wage and
        average house prices in the Boston area, along with the visual representation of the landscape.

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

      <p><em>We decided to prioritize addressing the housing needs of new graduates in the Boston region through three
          visualizations. The first visualization employs an X-axis to compare average house and apartment rents in
          areas like Waltham, Newton, and Watertown, aiding users in quickly identifying affordable options for
          comparison. The second visualization adds multiple views along with brushing and linking. It features a map
          with outlined neighborhoods, using colors to indicate relative price differences. Clicking on a neighborhood
          reveals detailed information for comparison, and a slider tracks post-COVID market trends. So, we have a view
          for all the neighborhoods and a view for the selections for comparison. However, if the slider for COVID
          trends becomes a bit infeasible to implement in d3, we might not pursue it as it is a secondary task in our
          lists. The third visualization also contains brushing and linking. It combines a shaded map reflecting housing
          prices with a table ranking areas by average wage similar to visualization 2. Users can interact by clicking
          on the table to highlight corresponding areas on the map, providing a comprehensive view that considers both
          housing affordability and wage levels. The primary goal is to make it easy for users to discern which
          areas/neighborhoods are more cost-effective, offering a valuable comparison tool. So, by interacting with the
          table, they can focus on a subset of areas/neighborhoods. In summary, we wanted to focus on making the tasks
          exploratory for the users so that they can compare and discover for themselves rather than make it a present
          task.

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be
          very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em>
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
          Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
          Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
